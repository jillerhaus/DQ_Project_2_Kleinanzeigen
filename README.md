# DataQuest Project 2: Ebay Kleinanzeigen

This is the second project from the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths of Dataquest. It is still very simple and focuses on using Pandas to analyze data on used cars sales on the German classifieds section of eBay: eBay Kleinanzeigen. The Analysis was done in the jupyter notebook. The raw dataset is contained in the `CSV` file.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` file to run

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install) The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy` and `Pandas` to run.
